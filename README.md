PLUGIN NOTES

This plugin will let you hide the MP Bar. Tales of Graces DOES NOT use an MP Bar, instead, they use the CC system
The NEXT area will show the players how many EXP needed to get to the next level. When I update the plugin later again, this will become a gauge
Tales of Graces also contains a second window to the right side. To make this a Tales of Graces experience, you can combine this plugin with Yanfly’s MainMenuVar plugin. You can inform the player of their gold, playtime, and more in that window
